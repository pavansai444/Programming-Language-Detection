make necessary changes in the code to change the paths corresponding to your local system.

There are three codes : 
-tradional models: Use this to run LinearSVC , Random Forest , KNN , SGD classifiers.
-Program_Detection_without_preprocessing : This takes the input without altering anything.
-Program_Detection_with_preprocessing: This preprocesses the input using lexical analysis texhniques.

Run all cells to obtain the output.

You can use custom test cases by adding your code to custom_X and expected label in custom_y.
